## Overview

**WARNING: POSSIBLE COMMAND CONFLICTS WITH OTHER BOTS USING THE '!' COMMAND PREFIX**

Lightweight discord bot with moderation capability and more. Subscribes to [Twitch's EventSub](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub) services to alert a Discord server when a subscription notification is received.

Invite the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824004407154835496&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## General Usage

- For a list of commands within Discord, just type "!help" in any channel where the bot can see messages.
- If you want more specific information on a single command, type "!help" followed by the command you'd like more information on. (EX: "!help help")
- Scroll down further for a quick setup guide for making use of the Twitch subscription service!

- Creating or removing a subscription to a specified Twitch broadcaster's `stream.online` notification

## Twitch Notification Subscription Usage

### ‚úîÔ∏è Setting up a new subscription

#### 1. Set the discord channel where you would like the announcements to go, and type !announce (requires Admin privileges)

| Find the Channel                                            | Type "!announce"                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Find the channel](./resources/images/announcechannel.png) | ![Type "!announce"](./resources/images/typeannounce.png) |

#### 2. Find the Twitch "login" username of the streamer you wish to subscribe to

![Where to find the Twitch User Login](./resources/images/twitchusername.png)

###### (This will be in the URL on Twitch)

#### 3. In any channel where the bot can see messages, type this command followed by the username found in Step 2: "!subtwitch"

![Type the subscription message](./resources/images/submessage.png)

#### 4. That's it! When that streamer goes live, the bot will receive a notification, and send a message to your preset announcements channel!

### ‚ùå Removing a subscription

Find the login name of the broadcaster/streamer (as shown above) that you would like to unsubscribe from, and type `!unsubtwitch <username>`

### üìú Listing active subscriptions

All you need to do is type `!listtwitch`. It's that easy!
